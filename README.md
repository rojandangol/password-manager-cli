# What it is: 

- Itâ€™s a practical tool that generates, stores, and retrieves secure passwords, with an emphasis on encryption to keep data safe.
- Uses python library for encrypting and decrypting passwords.
- Used HTML and JS for basic requests and a b/w web page.
- pw_manager.py can be used using the CLI but I wanted to see if this could be used on a web page. 
- Encrypted files can be found in storage.json


# Improvements that can be made but didn't want to

- Could've introduced data base to create user login. Username and password to make things more secure.
- This project was to test the python library and see how it worked. 
- Could make things more secure.
